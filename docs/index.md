## Installation

### Fetch The Source

Fetch the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pycontw/pycontw-postevent-report-generator.git
```

Create a working folder to place your attendee raw data outside of the source folder so you won't commit your raw data accidentally.

```sh
mkdir pycontw-postevent-report-generator-working
```

### Create Your Own Python Virtual Environment and Install package

```sh
inv env.init-dev
```

### Install Attendees Analyzer

If you want to develop it, please run:

```sh
inv build.develop
```

If you just want to install it in your virtual environment lib, please run:

```sh
inv build.install
```

Now you should be ready to go.

### Test The Installation

```sh
inv build.test-cli
```

### Run Test Cases

```sh
inv test
```

After launching your virtual environment, issue the following command:

```sh
rg-cli --csv ./a.csv --csv ./b.csv --csv ./c.csv --yaml ./report_generator/data/generic.yaml --package-yaml ./examples/packages.yaml --sponsor-yaml ./examples/sponsors.yaml
